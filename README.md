# Sports Tournament Management System

This project was developed as part of my BCA Semester 4 academic work.

It is a console-based system created to manage tournaments, teams, players, and match schedules.  
The project focuses on organizing data properly and performing operations using file handling instead of a database.

## What I Learned
- Breaking problems into smaller modules  
- Managing relationships between teams and players  
- Working with file operations  
- Planning system flow before coding
